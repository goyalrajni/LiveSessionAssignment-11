Live session Assignment-11

##Unit 11 Live Session Problem Instructions:
####Plot the time series. Can you identify seasonal fluctuations and/or a trend? 
####Use a classical decomposition to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices. 
####Do the results support the graphical interpretation from part (a)? 
####Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data. 
####Change one observation to be an outlier (e.g., add 500 to one observation), and recompute the seasonally adjusted data. What is the effect of the outlier? 
####Does it make any difference if the outlier is near the end rather than in the middle of the time series? 
####Use STL to decompose the series
